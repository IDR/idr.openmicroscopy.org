## General instructions

The raw data of all studies published in IDR can be downloaded using using anonymous File Transfer Protocol (FTP). We recommend using the [FileZilla client](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php).

You can download both whole studies as well as parts/single images.

The ftp host is available using the following details:

- host: `ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/IDR/`

## Desktop client step-by-step

Download and install the [FileZilla client](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php).

Start the FileZilla application. In the “Host” dialog (top-left corner) paste `ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/IDR/` and click the `Quickconnect` button.

Click OK in the next window.
