  - id: supportedformats
    question: What are the file formats accepted?
    answer: >
      The IDR uses the Bio-Formats library for reading imaging data.
      Bio-Formats supports over 150 proprietary and open file formats (see the
      <a href="https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/latest/supported-formats.html">full list</a>).
      At a minimum, your data should be readable by an up-to-date version of
      Bio-Formats e.g. using the <a href="https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/latest/users/comlinetools/display.html">showinf utility</a>
      or the Image/Fiji plugin.
  - id: recommendedformats
    question: What are the preferred formats for submission?
    answer: >
      We strongly encourage imaging data deposition using open file formats
      such as OME-TIFF. Where possible the original raw data should be
      submitted, though you can also submit analyzed or processed data if you
      think it is more usable.
  - idr: sizelimit
    question: Is there a size limit for data deposition?
    answer: >
      There is no size limit to the data that can be published in IDR. However
      for very large depositions (>10TB), please contact us as early as
      possible as special arrangements may be needed for data transfer.
  - id: embargo
    question: >
      Is it possible to restrict access to the data for some period? For 
      example, is it possible for data to be embargoed until publication of
      the manuscript?
    answer: >
      IDR holds and serves public data. IDR cannot take data that will remain
      private indefinitely, e.g. data that can only be shared with a specific
      set of collaborators. Please see info on OME’s
      <a href="https://www.openmicroscopy.org/omero/">OMERO</a> if you require
      project-specific, controlled data access.
      </br>
      IDR can embargo data for a defined period of time, usually so that data
      publication is coordinated with the publication of the associated
      peer-reviewed paper. <a href="mailto:idr@openmicroscopy.org">Contact the
      IDR team</a> for more info.
  - id: scheduling
    question: Is it possible to schedule a release date? 
    answer: >
      Scheduling a release date is possible, but will often be provisional.
      However, advance notice is required as we will only schedule a release
      date once all data has been submitted, validated, and all our data
      integrity and consistency checks are satisfied.  The amount of work and
      time this requires and our ability to honor an agreed publication date
      depends on the complexity of the datasets and, in many cases, how
      quickly authors respond to requests for clarifications, missing data
      etc. We’re happy to discuss all aspects of data submission at
      <a href="mailto:idr@openmicroscopy.org">idr [at] openmicroscopy.org</a>.
  - id: privateaccess
    question: >
      Is it possible to give access to embargoed data to authorized persons
      only?
    answer: >
      At the moment we do not provide any private access to embargoed data.
  - id: copyright
    question: Do authors retain the rights to their data?
    answer: >
      The authors of an IDR study retain copyright.  IDR receives a license to 
      publish the data on behalf of the authors. Every study in IDR is
      published using a permissive public license allowing to share and re-use
      the data, usually <a href="https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/">CC0</a>
      or <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC BY 4.0</a>.
  - id: nclicense
    question: Can my dataset be published under a non-commercial license?
    answer: >
      IDR's mission is to make reference image datasets as widely available as
      possible. We believe the industrial research and commercial imaging
      communities are critical parts of the larger scientific enterprise.
      Indeed our funders put a high premium on engagement with these
      communities. IDR policy is to use CC0 or CC-BY licensing on its data
      exactly to promote the widest re-use and impact of the several million
      GBPs of public and charity investment that has supported and continues
      to support the IDR.
  - question: Why are some datasets published under more restrictive licenses?
    answer: >
      There are some studies in IDR published under CC-BY-NC. These are
      largely datasets that IDR has re-published that used CC-BY-NC (or
      similar) in their original publication, specifically the JCB DataViewer,
      which ran from 2009 - 2016. However our policy is to use CC0 or CC-BY
      wherever possible.
  - id: cost
    question: How much does it cost to publish data in IDR?
    answer: >
      Data deposition and publication is free-of-charge to the authors and is
      supported by grants from the BBSRC, Wellcome Trust  and the European
      Commission.
  - id: longterm
    question: Does the repository have a long-term data preservation plan?
    answer: >
      IDR is currently funded by BBSRC and Wellcome as a collaboration between
      the OME Consortium and EMBL-EBI. It is a central component of
      EMBL-EBI’s open data mission in the domain of biological images (see
      <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-018-0195-8">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-018-0195-8</a> and
      <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/bioimage-archive/our-roadmap/">https://www.ebi.ac.uk/bioimage-archive/our-roadmap/</a> for more
      information).
  - id: securitypolicy
    question: >
      Has the repository implemented a security policy regarding its
      information system?
    answer: >
      The repository is hosted on EMBL-EBI infrastructure and as such a large
      portion of the security policy comes from EBI’s own policies. The IDR
      team has its own internal security policy which includes the protection
      of sensitive data such as embargoed submissions.
  - id: privateinformation
    question: >
      How does IDR handle private health identifiers (PHI) or personal
      identifying information (PII) that may be included in the data or
      metadata?
    answer: >
      IDR publishes fully anonymized data. We require that the submitters
      transfer to us data fully de-identified from PHI and PII. This is
      definitely the submitters' responsibility, since only the submitter will
      have sufficient knowledge of the data type to fully guarantee
      de-identification.
  - id: accession number
    question: When can I get an IDR accession number?
    answer: >
      An IDR accession number can be provided when we receive all image data
      along with completed metadata templates.
  - id: doi
    question: When can I get a DOI?
    answer: >
      A Data DOI will be minted following the public release of the data in
      IDR. A DOI cannot be provided before the data is publicly available in
      IDR.
  - id: cite
    question: How do I cite the IDR as a resource?
    answer: >
      The IDR is described in the following publication: Williams E,
      Moore J, Li SW, Rustici G, Tarkowska A, Chessel A, Leo S, Antal B,
      Ferguson RK, Sarkans U, Brazma A, Salas REC, Swedlow JR. The Image Data
