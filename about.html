We have collected and are continuing to receive existing and newly created “reference image" datasets that are valuable resources for a broad community of users, either because they will be frequently accessed and cited or because they can serve as a basis for re-analysis and the development of new computational tools.</p>

                        and <a href="http://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/products/omero">OMERO</a> tools to read, manage and
                        serve data, and provide links to EMBL-EBI’s molecular and structural resources. The resource is built
                        upon EMBL-EBI’s OpenStack-based Embassy infrastructure. All tools used for reading and converting
                        metadata associated with <a href="https://github.com/IDR/idr-metadata">each dataset</a> and all scripts
                        used to build the <a href="https://github.com/IDR/infrastructure">infrastructure</a> are maintained
                        and available. A parallel system that enables computational re-analysis of IDR data will be released soon.</p>

                        <p>The IDR includes a <a href="/jupyter">virtual analysis environment</a>
                        that provides full access to all data. Please contact us for an account.</p>

                        <p>Currently, (Mar 2017, version 0.3.4) the IDR contains &gt;42 Tb of multi-dimensional image data consisting of &gt;36 Mio individual planes
                        from 27 different imaging studies. IDR contains over a million different experiments. Data comes from studies on human, Drosophila,
                        budding and fission yeast, and mouse cells and tissue. Imaging modalities represented so far include high content screens, time-lapse
                        imaging, whole slide histopathology, and super-resolution microscopy.</p>
